# css-base
base for Counter-Strike: Source C++ mods, based on the Source SDK 2013 and 2018 leak<br>
**note, this is a base, no new features will be added, only bug fixes**
## bugs
* the Create Server menu has HL2DM elements
* sv_pure problems, workaround is to disable sv_pure by default (probably due to VPK hashses)
## compiling
compiling is like any SDK 2013 mod, read the VDC page on how to do it
